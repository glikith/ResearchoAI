# ResearchoAI
An AI-powered research assistant that generates fast, reliable, and cited reports from web data and user files.

<br/>

## 🤔 What's This All About?
ResearchoAI was born during the HackWithHyderabad pre-hackathon event. Our goal was to build a tool that cuts through the noise. Instead of spending hours sifting through search results, you can just ask a question and get a summarized, evidence-based report in seconds.

It's designed for students, researchers, or anyone who needs trustworthy information, fast.

## ✨ Key Features
AI-Powered Summaries: Ask any question and get a concise, easy-to-read report.

Multi-Source Answers: Pulls information from both the live web and any files you upload.

Built-in Citations: Every report includes its sources, so you know where the information came from.

Credit System: A simple, pay-as-you-go credit system for generating reports.

Always Fresh: Stays updated with the latest information from news and blogs.
